<p> I was the Social & Welfare officer of the <a href="https://www.nusu.co.uk/getinvolved/societies/society/gamingsoc/">Newcastle University Video Gaming and Esports Society</a> for 1 year in 2018/19, in which I controlled all of the society's social media and ensured that everyone was safe and happy in the society. During this time our society won a gold award for inclusivity, and we were the runner up for most inclusive society of 2018/19.</p>
<p> I have been a member of multiple esports teams, including captaining teams. Notable achievements are coming 2nd in <a href="https://www.belong.gg/tournaments/"> Belong Arena Clash </a> Overwatch Championship League in Summer 2018 and placing top 10 in the <a href="https://thenuel.com"> National University Esports League</a>. </p>
