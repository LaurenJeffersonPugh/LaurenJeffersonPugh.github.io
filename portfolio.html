<h2 id="aboutMe">About Me</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Lauren. I have interests in video games, technology&nbsp;and rock climbing. Currently, I'm a 2nd-year student at Newcastle Universty studying <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/undergraduate/degrees/g405/#courseoverview">Computing Science</a>. I am also the Social Secretary of the Newcastle University Gaming Society and a member of the <a href="https://www.belong.gg/overwatch/">Tyneside Guardians</a>; which is an Overwatch team based in Gateshead who are currently taking part in the Championship League of the <a href="https://www.belong.gg/arena-clash/">Belong Arena Clash</a>.</p>
<p>I have worked mainly with Java, Python3, HTML/CSS and Visual Basic; however, I also have experience with ARMv7 Assembly Language, JavaScript and JES.</p>

<h2 id=other>Other</h2>
<p> Being the Social Secretary of <a href="https://www.nusu.co.uk/getinvolved/societies/society/gamingsoc/">Newcastle University Gaming Society</a> means that I have to keep everyone up to date with current affairs in the society. This means I control all the social media for the society.</p>
<p>I am currently the captain of an esports team. This means I have to make quick decisions under a lot of pressure and I have to make sure I am very clear when communicating with the other members of the team. When I became captain of the team, 
I had to take on extra roles; for example, I had to be motivating and reassure members of the team when something didn't go to plan. I also have to pay attention to the strengths and weaknesses so that I can determine what roles to give each member of the team.
I have to make sure everyone works together as a team because, if we don't, it means that we're less successful in what we're trying to do.</p>
