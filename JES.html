<h1>JES Photo Manipulation</h1>
<p>I took part in <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/schools/partners/">PARTNERS</a>, which was a programme to help students get into Newcastle University. Whilst there I had to create a photo manipulation program using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jess_(programming_language)">JES (Jython Environment for Students)</a>.</p>
<h2>Skills Gained</h2>
<ul>

<li>Time Management - I had to build this program in 1 week. During this week I was ill, meaning by the time I recovered there were only 3 days left. I had to manage my time during these 3 days wisely, in order to complete the program. </li>
<li>Research - I had never coded with Jython before, therefore I had to research how to use it.</li>
<li>Programming - Whilst programming this project, I learnt how to use JES and code with Jython.</li>
